## Project Overview

**Task WebApp Frontend** is a comprehensive business management platform designed for field operations, financial tracking, and location-based workforce management. Built with modern web technologies, it provides real-time location validation, automated time tracking, and financial management capabilities for organizations with distributed teams.

### Core Capabilities

The application consists of four primary modules:

1. **Authentication & Authorization** - Role-based access control (Admin/User)
2. **Punch-In System** - Location-validated attendance with photo verification
3. **Financial Management** - Cash book, bank book, and debtor tracking
4. **Dashboard & Analytics** - Real-time insights and operational metrics

## Problem Statement

### Business Challenges

Organizations with field-based operations face several critical challenges:

#### 1. **Attendance Verification**
- Traditional time-tracking systems lack location verification
- No proof of physical presence at work locations
- Manual entry leads to inaccuracies and fraud
- Difficult to enforce proximity requirements

#### 2. **Financial Tracking**
- Fragmented financial data across multiple tools
- No real-time visibility into cash flow
- Manual reconciliation is time-consuming and error-prone
- Difficult to track debtors and outstanding payments

#### 3. **Operational Overhead**
- Managers spend excessive time on administrative tasks
- Lack of audit trails for compliance
- No centralized system for workforce management
- Poor mobile accessibility for field workers

### Technical Challenges

- Need for offline-first architecture for unreliable connectivity
- Real-time location validation without compromising privacy
- Secure authentication across multiple devices
- Responsive design for various screen sizes and devices
